## Features

- ‚ö° **Real-time Performance Metrics**
  - Total page load duration
  - Aggregate resource size (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
  - Number of HTTP requests
- üìä **Resource Breakdown**
  - Detailed analysis by resource type (scripts, images, stylesheets, etc.)
  - Size and request count per resource category
- üîç **Headless Browser Analysis**
  - Uses Puppeteer for accurate real-browser measurements
  - Captures lazy-loaded content and dynamic resources
- üé® **Modern UI**
  - Clean, responsive interface
  - Visual metrics cards
  - Color-coded resource breakdown
---

## How It Works

The application consists of a React frontend and an Express backend that uses Puppeteer to analyze website performance:

1. User enters a URL in the React interface
2. Frontend sends URL to backend API
3. Backend launches headless Chrome with Puppeteer
4. Puppeteer:
   - Navigates to the URL
   - Measures load time
   - Collects performance metrics
   - Calculates total page size
   - Counts network requests
5. Backend calculates resource breakdown by type
6. API returns metrics to frontend
7. React displays results in card format with resource breakdown
